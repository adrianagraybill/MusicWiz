## About MusicWiz: 
#### A modern take on the i-Pod classic/nano music quiz. 
* The old i-Pod music quiz would pull music from your library and play a small sound clip from one of the selected songs. This was great and while we wanted to recreate this fun app from the past we also wanted to improve upon it.
#### Features: 
* Pulls music from the device's music library and begins playing a song at random.
* Upon start up, a 15 second timer begins and displays as a countdown bar on the top of the screen.
* Displays the Album's cover art if present, otherwise will display a default music logo.
* Gives the user four options to choose from, one being the correct song while the others songs pulled from their library. 
* If the user chooses the correct answer, the timer resets and the user will gain points equal to the amount of time left.
* Tracks current score for the session as well as calculates a score for each answer based on time remaining to answer the question. 
#### Features to be added: 
* Scoreboard that tracks all high scores on the device
* Settings screen that allows the user to control the diffuculty as well as select different modes, themes, and filter by Genre
* Post game screen that display's the results of the game, which songs were guessed correct/incorrect.
* Landing screen that the user can use to navigate to different parts of the app.
